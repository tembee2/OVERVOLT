## Guidelines
* Roblox is still a game with kids on it, PLEASE keep it SFW and child friendly
* Do not spread misinformation, even though I manually review all pull requests. It's annoying to have to look for misinfo, so just don't put it in
* Do not generate wiki pages with AI ([More info on this](About AI.md))
* Just have common sense and be nice
