## Tutorial
The ingame tutorial kinda sucks and I'm too lazy to fix it so here is an explanation of the controls and UI

## The shop

The shop is a menu on the right of your screen where you can buy buildings to place.

### How to use
* Click on any building in the shop
* Move your mouse to the place you want to build
* Click the left mouse button
* Press C on your keyboard to stop placing

## Deleting
### To delete a building you placed:
* Press B to enter delete mode
* Click on the building
* Press C to exit delete mode

## Cards

Cards are the main way of unlocking talents and buildings.

### Cards can be obtained in 2 ways
* By phasing up, giving 1 Talent and 1 Building pack.
* By having the Starting Pack ability, giving 1 Talent and 1 Building pack when starting out.

### To use cards
* Get a pack
* Either click to reveal a card immediately or wait for all the cards to appear
* If you have not revealed any cards, you can pay 7 robux to reroll (Depends on phase, is 7 at phase 1-50)
* When you have revealed the cards, click on any card to pick it

## Money and Phase
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tembee2/OVERVOLT/refs/heads/master/docs/assets/MoneyAndPhase.png" style="float:right"/>

There are 2 counters at the bottom of your screen.
The Money and the Phase counter (It says tutorial at phase 0)

Money is used to buy buildings
Phase is how far you are in the game

### To phase up
* Gain enough money to phase up (All costs are [here](https://pastebin.com/8RYm7Bhf). The amount of money you need is how much you have earned in total that phase. NOT your current money)
* Press phase up (Clears factory, money and resets the map)

### To gain money
* Place a miner on a vein
* Connect conveyors so the ore goes to the black void in the middle of the map (the sell point)
* Profit

## Gears

Gears are an unfinished currency obtained by playing the game. (There is an algorithm, I don't want to explain.)
Gears save between runs.
